## 3. Description of the Service

TasteThreads is a social and AI-assisted planning tool that helps individuals and groups discover places (such as restaurants and activities), collaborate in shared rooms, and, in some cases, initiate reservations via third-party services like Yelp.

Core features may include:

- User authentication and profiles  
- Group chat rooms with human and AI participants  
- AI-powered recommendations using data from Yelp and your preferences, location context, and history  
- Saved places and AI “discoveries” maintained in your account  
- Optional integrations with services like WhatsApp and Yelp Reservations

We may add, modify, or remove features from time to time.

## 4. Third-party services and content

The Service integrates with and depends on third-party services, including but not limited to:

- **Firebase (Google)** for authentication and real-time data sync  
- **Yelp** (Yelp Fusion, Yelp AI, and Yelp Reservations APIs) for business data, recommendations, and reservations  
- **Meta / WhatsApp** for users who interact with TasteThreads via WhatsApp

You acknowledge and agree that:

- Third-party content (e.g., business listings, reviews, photos, ratings, availability, reservation responses) is provided “as is” by the relevant third party, not by DeepShot.  
- We do not control, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of third-party content or services.  
- Your use of third-party services may be subject to additional terms and privacy policies of those third parties.

If there is any conflict between these Terms and the terms of a third-party service, the third-party terms may govern your relationship with that third party.

---

## 5. AI-generated content & recommendations

The Service uses AI models (including third-party models) to generate:

- Restaurant and activity recommendations  
- Summaries, remarks, or “taste personas”  
- Responses in chat rooms (from “Tess” or similar AI personas)

You understand and agree that:

- AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate, and should not be relied upon as professional advice of any kind (including but not limited to legal, medical, financial, or safety advice).  
- Recommendations are suggestions only and may not reflect all available options or up-to-date information (such as current hours, pricing, or health/safety conditions).  
- You should independently verify critical information (e.g., location, operating hours, dietary or allergy suitability, reservation details) with the restaurant, venue, or relevant authority before acting.

DeepShot is not responsible for decisions you make or actions you take in reliance on AI-generated content or recommendations.

---

## 6. Your responsibilities & acceptable use

You agree **not** to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, or abusive purpose.  
- Harass, threaten, or harm other users or third parties.  
- Infringe or violate the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any person or entity.  
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, other accounts, or related systems or networks.  
- Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service (e.g., by overloading, spamming, or introducing malware).  
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code or underlying models, except where such restrictions are prohibited by law.  
- Use any automated system (e.g., bots, scrapers) to access the Service in a manner that sends more requests than a human could reasonably produce.

We may take any action we deem appropriate (including suspension or termination of access) if we believe your use violates these Terms or risks harm to the Service or others.

---

## 7. User content

You may submit or share content through the Service, including chat messages, room names, profile information, bios, and other materials (“**User Content**”).

You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant DeepShot a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, adapt, and display your User Content as reasonably necessary to operate, improve, and provide the Service (including for features like group chats, AI recommendations, and saved places).

You represent and warrant that:

- You have all rights necessary to submit the User Content and grant the above license.  
- Your User Content, and our use of it as permitted by these Terms, does not violate any law or infringe any third party’s rights.

We may, but have no obligation to, review, remove, or block User Content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful.

---

## 8. Reservations and transactions

Some features of the Service enable you to check reservation availability, place holds, or complete bookings with third parties (e.g., restaurants via Yelp Reservations).

You understand and agree that:

- Reservations and any related purchases are **between you and the third party** (e.g., the restaurant or Yelp), not DeepShot.  
- DeepShot does not guarantee availability, pricing, or the quality or safety of any restaurant, venue, or experience.  
- DeepShot is not a party to your payment transactions, and we do not store your credit card details; those are handled by third-party payment processors used by Yelp or the restaurant.  
- Any issues regarding reservations (including cancellations, refunds, or disputes) should be resolved directly with the third party.

---

## 9. Intellectual property

The Service, including its software, design, logos, text, graphics, and other content (excluding User Content and third-party content), is owned by DeepShot or its licensors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Service for your personal, non-commercial use.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or create derivative works based on the Service, in whole or in part, except as explicitly permitted by these Terms or applicable law.
