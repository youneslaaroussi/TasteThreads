## 2. Information we collect

We collect information in several ways: (a) you provide it directly, (b) it is collected automatically when you use the app, and (c) it is received from third parties such as Firebase and Yelp.

### 2.1 Account & authentication data

When you create or use an account:

- **Identifiers**: Firebase user ID, email address, and (if you choose) display name.  
- **Authentication data**: Authentication tokens issued by Firebase (we do **not** store your password; Firebase Auth manages credentials).  
- **Sign in with Apple**: Apple may provide us with your Apple identifier and optional name/email, which we store where necessary for your account.

### 2.2 Profile & reservation contact data

Through your profile and reservation settings, we may collect:

- Name and display name  
- Bio or short description  
- Profile image URL or uploaded avatar (which may be stored as a URL or encoded image data)  
- Taste and preference strings (e.g. cuisines, dietary constraints, vibes, price sensitivity)  
- Optional contact details for reservations: first name, last name, phone number, email address

### 2.3 Location and context data

To personalize restaurant and venue recommendations:

- **Approximate location**: City, state, country, and coordinates rounded to a coarse precision (e.g. ~100m).  
- **Derived context**: Time of day, day of week, and inferred “meal time” (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner).  
- **Location history summary**: High-level summaries such as favorite areas or categories inferred from your saved places and AI discoveries.

We do **not** continuously track precise GPS trails; we use coarse-grained coordinates and cached, reverse-geocoded location primarily to help find relevant nearby places.

### 2.4 Saved places, AI discoveries, and taste profile

When you save locations or accept AI suggestions, we store:

- Saved locations and AI-discovered locations, including:  
  - Name, address, latitude/longitude, rating  
  - Yelp business identifiers and metadata (e.g. price range, categories, hours, review counts)  
  - Our internal AI remarks or summaries about places (e.g. why they might be a good fit for you)  
- Aggregated summaries of your tastes (e.g. frequently visited cuisines, typical price range) generated from your saved places and history.

### 2.5 Rooms, chat, and collaboration data

To support group planning and AI conversations, we store:

- **Rooms and memberships**: Room identifiers, room names, owner and member IDs, and membership history.  
- **Messages**: Chat content (including messages between you, your group, and Tess (our AI assistant)), timestamps, message types (text, system, map, etc.), basic metadata (e.g. reactions, quick replies), and attached business cards / itinerary data.  
- **Typing indicators and presence**: Short-lived records that a given user is typing in a given room (used solely to show “is typing” indicators).

Messages and room state are stored both in our primary database and in Firebase Firestore to power real-time sync.

### 2.6 Reservation data (Yelp Reservations)

When you use reservation features that integrate with Yelp Reservations, we may send on your behalf:

- Restaurant identifier (Yelp business ID)  
- Desired date, time, party size  
- Your reservation contact details: first name, last name, email, phone, and a device or user identifier required by Yelp  
- Optional notes for the restaurant

Reservation requests and confirmations are processed by Yelp’s APIs. We do **not** handle or store your payment card details; if a credit card is required, you will typically complete that step directly with Yelp or the restaurant.

### 2.7 Usage, diagnostics, and log data

We may collect:

- App events, API calls, and error logs (e.g. to detect failed searches, performance issues, or abuse)  
- Device information such as OS version, app version, language, and basic device characteristics  
- Aggregated, de-identified analytics to understand how the Service is used

## 4. How we share information

We do **not** sell your personal information. We share it only as described below:

### 4.1 Service providers and infrastructure

We use trusted third parties to operate the Service, including:

- **Firebase (Google)** for authentication, real-time sync (Firestore), and token management

These providers process data on our behalf under appropriate agreements and security measures.

When you participate in a room:

- Other room members may see your display name, messages, profile image, and any shared content in that room.  
- AI suggestions and saved places that come from room conversations may be attributed to your account and shown to you later.

### 4.3 Yelp and reservations

When you request Yelp searches or reservations:

- We send query details, coarse location, and sometimes reservation contact details to Yelp’s APIs.  
- Yelp may log and process this information under its own terms and privacy policy. We do not control their independent use of your data.

### 4.4 Legal, safety, and rights protection

We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:

- Comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal processes, or government requests  
- Protect the safety, rights, or property of our users, the public, or DeepShot  
- Detect, prevent, or address fraud, security, or technical issues

We retain your information for as long as necessary to:

- Provide the Service and maintain your account

- Comply with legal or regulatory obligations

If you request account deletion, we will delete or de-identify your personal information within a reasonable timeframe, subject to data we must retain for legal, security, or operational reasons (e.g. preventing abuse).
